Creating new knowledge is an act of transitioning from known effect to unknown cause.
That unknown cause we imagine as some external object. We call this hypothesis.Â 

This transition from known effect to unknown cause is known also as abductive reasoning (Pierce), conjecture (Popper), understanding (Schopenhauer) or a simply a guess.

Now, no matter how smart AGI gets he does not have ability to correctly guess right hypotheses out of million possible hypotheses. For validation he needs feedback from real world or controlled experiment. Knowledge is a process of trial and error in every field - from simple insect perception, through market discovery all the way to scientific theories. 

I don't belive prophecies that superinteligent AGI will discover all there is by just simply contemplating.

That is why I am thinking of creating an app where ChatGPT can propose hypotheses and how to test them and people can crowdfund experiments to confirm those hypothesis.

So basically it will be a list of hypotheses for known problems with ability to crowdfund it.

If my thinking is correct then the future will look a lot like ChatGPT proposing hypotheses and humans working on funding and making experiments to confirm the hypothesis. This will be the new economy. The whole world will be one big lab.
