## Three types of refactoring


Technical vs Domain
Mechanical vs Domain

Breakthrough/insights -> new abstractions
 
 Symptoms:
- Edge cases that needs to be handled
- hard to understand/lot's of things going on but everyone is afraid to say obvious because "someone" very important already did "refactoring" and call it a day.
- generic class names like Item

Benefits: greater **explanatory** power. Why is it written that way.
