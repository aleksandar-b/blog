This is a draft post, I will try to improve it by time.

There is a lot of discussion lately about the AGI. It seems like it really is generaly inteligent. But two main problems with AGI are cited: 

1. It can not understand
2. It can not create any new knowledge

I will show you that those two things are closely related. They are described by Arthur Schopenhauer who wrote extensively about faculty of Understanding 200 years ago. I will also try to explain you how Understanding differs from abstract Reasoning.

#### What is Understanding?

Shortly, Understanding is a knowledge of cause and effect.

> Understanding is the same in all animals and in all men; it has everywhere the same simple form; knowledge of causality, transition from effect to cause, and from cause to effect, nothing more; - Arthur Schopenhauer

> These philosophies are just tricky way to ***compute consequences quickly. Philosophy which is sometimes called Understanding*** of the law is simply a way that the person holds law in his mind so ***he gets quickly to the consequences***. - Richard Feynman


#### Difference between Understanding and Reasoning

Schopenhauer makes clear distintion between Understanding and Reasoning. Understanding is the thing we share with our brothers animals. It was created  with the development of first sense so we could create perceptions from raw senses. It consists of **inferring unknown causes for the given effect** where effect is our sense activation and cause is some external object. This is called direct Understanding, common to simple animals, whether indirect Understanding is more advanced and is common for humans where we try to infer causal relations between external object themselves(science). This whole process creates our perception by inferring causes for given effect with the help of Time and Space.

Later we developed Reason - ability to make abstract concepts out of perception. Although imperfect because it consists of removing all that is non-essential it allowed us to store it somewhere for the future and pass it to others via language. That ability to think in abstract conceptions separated us from animals - and because of that we have what animals don't - things like language, laughter, live in the past and future etc.

#### Perception > Conception

You may come to conclusion that Reasoning is better than Understanding because it is more "human" but Schopenhauer is strongly against this. He thought that only knowledge of perception, of immediate Understanding of causal relation of things is real knowledge and that other knowledge of abstract reasoning are just second hand ideas. 


#### All new knowledge is the work of Understanding

Although conceptions are usefull becose they bring under one concept innumerable many things, they still can not create nothing new, because everything is already present in premises (deduction), or knowledge can be created with more data(induction) - but induction from large amount of data is almost always never certain - only Causality or in broader terms Reason brings us certain knowledge.
For example we can collect huge amount of data that human heart is always on the left side of the chests, but there are cases where some people heave hearts on the right side.
 
>The great value of conceptions lies in the fact that by means of them the
original material of knowledge is more easily handled, surveyed,  
and arranged. But although many kinds of logical and dialectical  
operations are possible with them, **yet no entirely original and new  
knowledge will result from these**; that is to say, no knowledge  
whose material neither lay already in perception nor was drawn  
from self-consciousness.  

For example - Hooke's or Newton's discovery of Law of gravity, or Lavoisier's discovery of acids, or Einstein's discovery of theory of Relativy did not come from inductive or deductive Reasoning - it came from a happy moment when they discovered some hidden causal connections between data that was already there. The way they did it is that they inferred (made a guess or hypothesys) cause for some effect and suddenly they saw clearly because from then inborn or apriory Causality jumps in and says to them - this is it.

> Every one of these great discoveries is therefore, just like perception, an operation of the understanding, an immediate intuition, and as such the work of an instant, an apperÃ§u, a flash of insight. They are not the result of a process of abstract reasoning, which only serves to make the immediate knowledge of the understanding permanent for thought by bringing it under abstract concepts, i.e., it makes knowledge distinct, it puts us in a position to impart it and explain it to others.

> ***New insight***, on the contrary, can only be obtained by the help of the faculty of judgment, from perception, which alone is complete and rich knowledge.

This is how animal and numan brain works - it constatly makes a guess about which object caused sensation (sight, touch etc) on our body, but our brain does this at very high speed and we are not aware of this. This is all the work of understanding and end result is perception or knowledge about the world.

The scientiests do the same thing just very slowly and they try to infer cause and effect between external objects themselves not on our body directly.

Here are some more quotes of Arthur Schopenhauer.
