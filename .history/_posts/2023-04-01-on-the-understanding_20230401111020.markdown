On the Understanding

We see lot of discussion about AI lately. Two main problems are cited: 

1. It does not understand
2. It can not create any new knowledge

I will show you why does two things are closely related and they are noticed by Arthur Schopenhauer who wrote extensively about faculty of Understanding 200 years ago, but whose insights are very relevant.

What is Understanding?

Shortly, Understanding is a knowledge of cause and effect taken directly from perception. Actually Understanding creates our perception from raw senses by transforming them with it's own "software" - Time, Space and Causality. 

Richard Feynman
Holds law in his mind so it gets quickly to the consequences
Tricky way to compute consequence quickly.

Difference between Understanding and Reason

Why it can not create any new knowledge
