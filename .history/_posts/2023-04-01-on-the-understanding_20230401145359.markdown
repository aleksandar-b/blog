On the Understanding

There is a lot of discussion lately about the AGI. Two main problems with AGI are cited: 

1. It can not understand
2. It can not create any new knowledge

I will show that those two things are closely related and they are noticed by Arthur Schopenhauer who wrote extensively about faculty of Understanding 200 years ago. I will also show you how Understanding differs from Reasoning.

What is Understanding?

Shortly, Understanding is a knowledge of cause and effect taken directly from perception. Actually Understanding creates our Perception from raw senses. It has it's own "software" that does that and it consists of 3 components - Time, Space and Causality.

> Understanding is the same in all animals and in all men; it has everywhere the same simple form; knowledge of causality, transition from effect to cause, and from cause to effect, nothing more; - Arthur Schopenhauer

> These philosophies are just tricky way to ***compute consequences quickly***. Philosophy which is sometimes called ***Understanding*** of the law is simply a way that the person holds law in his mind so it ***gets quickly to the consequences***. - Richard Feynman


Difference between Understanding and Reasoning

Schopenhauer sharply distinquishes between Understanding and Reasoning. Understanding is the thing we share with our brothers animals. It was created when first sense was developed so that we could explain things. As he puts it - this whole world ergo our whole knowledge or Perception of it started when first creature opened his eye. Before that it was nothing. We were just plants with a stimuli. When knowledge was created through Understanding interpreting raw senses then we got something call Motive - and we started to move in search of that motive. We where not static plants anymore.

Later we developed Reason - ability to make abstract concepts out of perception. Although imperfect because it consists of removing all that is non-essential it allowed us to store it somewhere for the future and pass it to others via language. That ability to think in abstract conceptions separated us from animals - and because of that we have what animals don't:

1. Language - which is just a way to exchange abstract concetions with others
2. Laugther - Laugh is just a insight that abstract concept does not match perception, or that perception does not match abstract concept
3. High scale cooperations like State, Enterprises that involves long term planning.
4. Another motive - abstract motive
5. Live in the Future, not just in present

Perception > Conception

You may come to conclusion that Reasoning is better than Understanding because it is more "human" but Schopenhauer is strongly against this. He thought that only knowledge of perception, of immediate Understanding of causal relation of things is real knowledge and that other knowledge of abstract reasoning are just shadows. He calls Reasoning with abstract notions secondary quality, feminime characteristic in a sense that it can only receive  - it can not create but only can give you what it already has. Or jugling with abstract notions with deductions and inductions can not produce anything new.

Why it can not create any new knowledge?
